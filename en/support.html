				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: Can I redistribute products distributed under a libre software license?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: <b>Only official stable binaries</b> are been able to distributed without authorisation; in such cases, please note that they are not NJB authorised.<br>
					For licenses without a source code disclosure clause, such as the 3-clause BSD license, you do not need to include the source code.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: I modified a product distributed under a libre software license. Can I distribute it?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: <b>You can only distribute it if the NJB's trademark has been removed.</b> This is necessary to prevent users from mistaking the derivative work as NJB authorised.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: How about screenshots?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: The following fair uses for libre softwares don't require permission.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If a magazine or website has screenshots of our software or website</li>
						<li>TV shows or movies has a screen of NJB products</li>
						<li>Place screenshots in commercial publications, whether or not they focus on NJB products</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: Are trademark restrictions inconsistent with the libre software principle?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: That's not true. Many libre software licenses exclude trademark rights and are based on the principle of libre software. A trademark is a proof of quality that protects users.<br>
					Also see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.en.html#trademarks" target="_blank">the mention of the Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: Isn't it inconsistent with the GPL to put logos, game assets, etc. under different licenses?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: Not contradictory, since logos, wallpapers, game scenario scripts (such as those developed by ONScripter, Ren'Py, and other game engines with GPL or LGPL portions), images, and sound files are just data used for the program.(Please also refer to the "Can I quote materials in the product?" section of the <a href="#game">"For Video Games" section</a>.<br>
					Note that libre free software binaries developed by NJB in totally from scratch are distributed under the 3-clause BSD license, <a>and in such cases this question does not hold in practice.</b></p>

				<p class="theme-red tx-22">For CD-EXTRA</p>

				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: What's CD-EXTRA?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: A compact disc that combines music (CD-DA) and computer data in a single session. The specification is defined in the so-called Blue Book.A compact disc that combines music (CD-DA) and computer data in a single session. The specification is defined in the so-called Blue Book.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: Why does NJB release CD-EXTRAs?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: This is because we don't want to waste extra space on a single or mini album, and we use the space more efficiently.<br>
					However, as a general rule, full albums are released under the normal CD-DA format.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: What kind of data will be included?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: We plan to record sound sources with higher quality than CDs (so-called Hi-Res). Basically, it is 48kHz/24bit FLAC.</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: How do I listen to that?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: The music area can be played on CD-DA compatible devices such as CD players, CD-playable components or radio cassette players, DVD players, and game consoles.<br>
					In addition to normal sound sources, you can play back sound and video recorded in the data area on a computer using general-purpose player software.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There are cases that only the data area is displayed in file explorer, but you can play the music area with various music player software.</li>
						<li>On Macintosh and Linux/GNU/X, the CD-DA area and the data area may be displayed separately, but there is no problem with the operation.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: Can I rip the sound source from CD-EXTRAs?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: It has been confirmed that CD-DA sources can be extracted by various ripping software. Sound sources in the data area can be copied and pasted from File Explorer to a fixed drive or USB memory.<br>
					※On the freedb server, Perhaps its tracks name are registered in English or the data area is registered as one song with the title of "extra data".</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: Doesn't the sound quality get worse?</strong></span></p>
					<p>A: For CD-DA sources, there is no degradation of sound quality unless there is at least a C2 error (an error that does not go away after two corrections).<br>
					The sound source in the data area has a higher bit depth value than the normal sound source, so the sound quality is higher.</p>

					<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Q: Can I upload the play video of the NJB's video game?</strong></span></p>
