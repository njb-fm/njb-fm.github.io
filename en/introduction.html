			<p class="theme-red tx-22">What's NJB?</p>
			<p>In July 2017, NJB was established as the "Uchikawa Central Broadcasting Station" in order to provide FM microbroadcasting closer to the local community.<br>
			In 2018, the name was changed to Radio New Japan Broadcasting Club, and in February 2024, in order to concentrate on the software development business, and restarted as Naka-mura Jukebox.<br>
			What we are aiming for is local growth, and an insatiable quest.
